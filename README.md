My Implementation of Interesting Algorithms

### 1. Karger's Min Cut Algorithm
This interesting randomized algo is used to split a graph into two - with minimum number of cuts(of edges) as possible. 
Interestingly, this algorithm is not *correct* in the traditional sense, but with probability theory,
one can define a lower bound for the probability of finding the min-cut that is quite high (close to 1), by using independence of repeated trials.
